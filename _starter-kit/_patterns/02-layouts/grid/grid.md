_Layout for Grid_

### Variables:
* modifier_classes: [string] modifier class for creating variant.
* content: [object] grid content.

#### Usage
To create a grid, include the grid.twig file and pass it a class via
the modifier_classes variables (e.g., l-grid--3col).  Do not
reference the twig files in the column subdirectories (e.g.,
grid-3-column) directly as they are just visual examples for Pattern
Lab.
