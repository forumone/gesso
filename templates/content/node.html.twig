  * Theme override to display a node.
  *
  * Available variables:
  * - node: The node entity with limited access to object properties and methods.
      Only "getter" methods (method names starting with "get", "has", or "is")
      and a few common methods such as "id" and "label" are available. Calling
      other methods (such as node.delete) will result in an exception.
  * - label: The title of the node.
  * - content: All node items. Use {{ content }} to print them all, or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}.
  * - author_picture: The node author user entity, rendered using the "compact" view mode.
  * - metadata: Metadata for this node.
  * - date: Themed creation date field.
  * - author_name: Themed author name field.
  * - url: Direct URL of the current node.
  * - display_submitted: Whether submission information should be displayed.
  * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
  *   - node: The current template type (also known as a "theming hook").
  *   - node--type-[type]: The current node type.
  *   - node--display-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the node.
  *   The following are controlled through the node publishing options.
  *   - node--promoted: Appears on nodes promoted to the front page.
  *   - node--sticky: Appears on nodes ordered above other non-sticky nodes in teaser listings.
  *   - node--unpublished: Appears on unpublished nodes visible only to site admins.
  * - title_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main title tag that appears in the template.
  * - content_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main content tag that appears in the template.
  * - author_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the author of the node tag that appears in the template.
  * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
  * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
  * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
  * - teaser: Flag for the teaser state. Will be true if view_mode is 'teaser'.
  * - page: Flag for the full page state. Will be true if view_mode is 'full'.
  * - readmore: Flag for more state. Will be true if the teaser content of the node cannot hold the main body content.
  * - logged_in: Flag for authenticated user status. Will be true when the current user is a logged-in member.
  * - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user is an administrator.
