# Sass

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is a scripting language that gets compiled into
CSS. This theme uses the SCSS syntax, so any valid CSS you write is also valid
SCSS. [Variables](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variables_),
[Nesting](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#css_extensions),
and [Mixins](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins)
are just a few of Sass’s powerful features.

## File Structure

This Sass file structure uses many of the ideas discussed in Jonathan Snook’s
[SMACSS](http://smacss.com) and is intended to provide a starting point for
building modular, scalable CSS using Sass and Drupal.

It’s recommended that you follow the
[Drupal 8 CSS architecture guidelines](https://drupal.org/node/1887918).

### styles.scss
This file shouldn’t contain any CSS code. It only serves to combine the CSS
contained in other Sass partials through @import directives. By default, the
compiled styles.css file is sent to all browsers except IE8 and below.

### no-mq.scs
A duplicate of styles.scss, but includes legacy support for older browsers. By
default, the compiled no-mq.css file is only sent to IE8 and below.

### pattern-lab.scss
A file only loaded by Pattern Lab.  Styles specific to the Pattern Lab UI (or other
styles that the theme should not output to Drupal) may be placed here.

### partials/_global.scss
Global extensions, variables, functions, and mixins that should be imported into
all scss files.

### partials/_base.scss
CSS reset based on [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css) and
default styles for HTML elements. Custom font declarations go here as well.

### partials/_helper-classes.scss
Helper classes that aren’t components themselves, such as clearfix.

### partials/_module_tweaks.scss
Minor tweaks for styles provided by Drupal modules.

### partials/_layout.scss
The layout of major regions that components will be placed into.

### partials/_components.scss
Discrete, reusable UI components. (Think SMACSS “modules”.) The majority of your
styles should be here.

### partials/_quick-fixes.scss
Deadlines happen, so put your quick fixes here. Hopefully there will be time
later to move/re-factor these styles into their proper place.

### overrides/
Stylesheets provided by Drupal modules that you want to completely override go
here. Please update gesso_css_alter() in includes/css.inc to ensure the module’s
stylesheet is not added and this stylesheet is added in its place.

### panels-admin/
When creating Panels layouts, stylesheets for the Panels admin interface belong
in this directory.


## SMACSS

You should try to abstract your components as much as possible to promote reuse
throughout the theme. Components should be flexible enough to respond to any
width and should never rely on context (e.g., .sidebar-first .component) for
styling. This allows components to be placed throughout the theme with no risk
of them breaking.

If you find you need to change the look of a component depending on its context,
you should avoid using context based classes at all costs. Instead, it is better
to add another modifier class to the component to alter the styling.

Sub-components are the individual parts that make up a component. As a general
rule, adding a class to target a sub-component is a much better option than
using descendant selectors or element selectors. In many cases sub-components
can be made more reusable by making them components in their own right, so they
can then be used within other components.
