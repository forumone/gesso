# Gesso

Gesso is a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)-based and [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io) integrated starter theme that outputs
accessible HTML5 markup. It uses a mobile-first responsive approach and
leverages [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) to organize styles as outlined in the
[Drupal 8 CSS architecture guidelines](https://www.drupal.org/node/1887918).
This encourages a component-based approach to theming through the creation of
discrete, reusable UI elements. Gesso is heavily integrated with
[Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) and the
[Component Libraries](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) module,
allowing Drupal and Pattern Lab to share the same markup.

For more information, view the
[Gesso Drupal project page](https://drupal.org/project/gesso/) or
[Gesso GitHub repo](https://github.com/forumone/gesso).

### Global Prerequisites
The following packages need to be installed on your system in order to use
Gesso.

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)

In addition, in order to compile Twig files, Pattern Lab requires that PHP be available on the command line.

## Installation

1. Place the Gesso theme in your site’s theme directory. (e.g.,
themes/gesso) Read documentation on
[installing themes](https://drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib/themes)
for more information.

2. Install the
[Component Libraries](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) module.
Since many of the Drupal templates reference twig files inside Pattern Lab using
Twig namespaces, this module is required for the theme to function.

3. Enable the Gesso Helpers module. This module comes packaged with the theme,
but must be manually enabled for the theme to function.

4. Optional: Install the
[Twig Field Value](https://www.drupal.org/project/twig_field_value) module.
This is not required, but will make working with Twig templates easier.

5. Optional: Install the
[Twig Tweak](https://www.drupal.org/project/twig_tweak) module.
This is not required, but will make working with Twig templates easier.

6. Optional: Because Gesso is a starter theme, you may want to rename the
Gesso directory or copy its contents to a new custom theme directory based on
the name of your project.

The easiest way to accomplish this is to use
[Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush).
Type `drush gesso --help` for more information.

If you can’t use Drush, then manually replace all instances of 'gesso'
within this directory with a machine-readable name of your choice, including
folder names, filenames, and all occurrences within files. This custom name must
start with a letter and may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and
underscores.

Edit the .info.yml file and update the theme name and description. You can also
change the screenshot image (images/screenshot.png) shown on the Appearance
admin page.


### Compiling Pattern Lab and Sass

[LibSass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass) is required to compile the Sass into
CSS. Gesso includes Gulp tasks to compile the CSS and generate the compiled
Pattern Lab files and to watch both for changes. To use these tasks, first run
the following NPM command in the theme folder.

```
npm install
```

To initiate the Gulp build tasks that compile the Sass and Pattern Lab files and watch for changes, run the following command in the theme directory:

```
gulp
```

To initiate the Gulp build tasks only (without watching for changes), run the following command in the theme directory:

```
gulp gessoBuild
```


### Accessing Pattern Lab

To access the Pattern Lab instance, append `/pattern-lab/public/index.html` to your site URL and theme directory (e.g. http://localhost:8080/themes/gesso/pattern-lab/public/index.html) or, if developing locally,  just open that index.html file directly in the browser from your file system.


### Creating New Components

Gesso includes a script to generate new component files. To use, run the
following command in the theme folder.

```
node component
```


### Build Artifacts

By default, the compiled Pattern Lab and Sass files (e.g., /pattern-lab/
and /css/) are ignored by Git as these files are built during deployment.
To change this, edit the included .gitignore file.


### Sass/Gulp dependencies

* [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com): Easy to write media queries.

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com): CSS on steroids. Adds nested rules, variables,
mixins, selector inheritance, and more.

* [Sass Globbing](https://github.com/mikevercoelen/gulp-sass-glob): Adds
glob-based imports to Sass.

* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer): Adds necessary
browser CSS property prefixes during Sass compilation.


### Stylelint

[Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) is used to lint Sass files. Warnings will
break the build, so if you have a valid reason to break Stylelint rules you can
have it ignore code in two ways:

1. Add `/* stylelint-disable-next-line */` to the line just before where the
Stylelint warning is triggered.

2. To ignore several lines, add `/* stylelint-disable */` before the code in
question and add `/* stylelint-enable */` afterwards.
