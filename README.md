# Gesso

Gesso is a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)-based starter theme that outputs
accessible HTML5 markup. It uses a mobile-first responsive approach and
leverages [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) to organize styles as outlined in the
[Drupal 8 CSS architecture guidelines](https://www.drupal.org/node/1887918).
This encourages a component-based approach to theming through the creation of
discrete, reusable UI elements.

For more information, view the
[Gesso Drupal project page](https://drupal.org/project/gesso/) or [Gesso GitHub repo](https://github.com/forumone/gesso).

[Gesso issue queue](https://github.com/forumone/gesso/issues).


## Required Modules

This theme requires the following Drupal modules:

* [HTML5 Tools](https://drupal.org/project/html5_tools): Provides HTML5 elements
for use in fields and forms, updates Drupal core markup to match HTML5
standards, and streamlines CSS and JavaScript tags.

* [Magic](https://drupal.org/project/magic): Provides advanced CSS/JavaScript
handling and includes theme development enhancements.


## Recommended modules

* [Blockify](https://drupal.org/project/blockify): Exposes a number of core
  Drupal elements, traditionally found in page.tpl.php, as blocks. This theme
  does not include these items in page.tpl.php to allow greater flexibility in
  where they can be placed.

* [Clean Markup](https://drupal.org/project/clean_markup): Allows you to control
  the markup of blocks, panel regions, and panel panes via the UI.

* [Modernizr](https://drupal.org/project/modernizr): Provides deep integration
  with the Modernizr JS library, allowing modules and themes to register tests
  and load additional assets as needed.


## Installation

1.  Place the Gesso theme in your site’s theme directory.
    (e.g., sites/all/themes/gesso) Read documentation on
    [installing themes](https://drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib/themes)
    for more information.

2.  Because Gesso is a starter theme, it may be best to rename the Gesso
    directory or copy its contents to a new custom theme directory based on the
    name of your project.

    The easiest way to accomplish this is to use [Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush).
    Type `drush gesso --help` for more information.

    If you can’t use Drush, then manually replace all instances of 'gesso'
    within this directory with a machine-readable name of your choice, including
    folder names, filenames, and all occurrences within files. This custom name
    must start with a letter and may only contain lowercase letters, numbers,
    and underscores.

3.  Edit the .info file and update the theme name and description. You can also
    change the screenshot image (images/screenshot.png) shown on the Appearance
    admin page.


## Configuration

Gesso includes several theme-specific settings for managing classes output by
Drupal, which you can change at admin/appearance/settings/gesso.


### Pattern Lab installation

The included Grunt tasks look for an instance of the Drupal standard edition of
Pattern Lab and the Gesso Twig starter kit in a subdirectory of the theme called
'pattern-lab'.  The Grunt build task will skip building Pattern Lab if this
directory is not found.

To install Pattern Lab, run the following Composer command in
the theme directory.

```
$ composer create-project pattern-lab/edition-drupal-standard pattern-lab
```
When prompted, select /forumone/starterkit-twig-drupal-gesso as the starterkit.

If prompted, select 'r' to overwrite existing /source/ files.



### Compiling Sass

[LibSass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass) is required to compile the Sass into
CSS. Gesso includes Grunt tasks to compile the CSS/Pattern Lab files and to
watch them for changes.  To use these tasks, run the following NPM command in
the theme folder (Windows users may need to include the `--no-bin-links` flag at the end of the command).
```
npm install
```
To run the Grunt build task, run
```
grunt
```

### Build Artifacts

By default, the compiled Pattern Lab and Sass files (e.g., /pattern-lab/public/
and /css/) are ignored by Git as these files are built during deployment.  
To change this, edit the included .gitignore file.


### Sass/Grunt dependencies

* [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com): Easy to write media queries.

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com): CSS on steroids. Adds nested rules, variables,
mixins, selector inheritance, and more.

* [Sass Globbing](https://github.com/DennisBecker/grunt-sass-globbing): Adds glob-
based imports to Sass.

* [Singularity](http://singularity.gs): Grid-based layout system.

* [SVG2PNG](https://github.com/dbushell/grunt-svg2png): Rasterizes SVG to PNG images using PhantomJS.

* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer): Adds necessary browser CSS property prefixes during Sass compilation.
